# Build a Mini LLM Inference Server

Construct a complete LLM inference stack from scratch: sampling, tokenization, a tiny transformer with KV caching, a paged attention allocator, continuous batching with scheduling, a streaming serving API, and a throughput/latency benchmark harness. This mirrors the architecture of modern serving systems like vLLM at a digestible scale.

## How to run

```bash
python scaffold.py
```
